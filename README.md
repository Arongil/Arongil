# Welcome to Arongil.com

Here you can find a portfolio of some of the cooler projects I've worked on. Explore some of them below!

## Products 

* *Scheduler*, a constraint satisfaction solver with frontend written in JavaScript made to schedule classes for my high school.
* *Shhh!*, a program which listens for noise in a quiet group study space and loudly alerts students who are too loud.
* *Realtime*, a 3D graphing engine that connects up to Khan Academy's image API which I created to help create visual exercises for [multivariable calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus).
* *Rebel Reader*, a NodeJS app that connects to the Google Translate API to generate interactive language learning practice based on whatever foreign text you input.
* *Random Caller*, a simple program to call on students in class which I built while teaching theoretical linear algebra at Khan Lab School.
* *Disease Simulation*, a prescient program (built in 2017) that models the spread of disease globally via airline networks.
* *Programs Collections*, a slapdash portfolio of other projects I like to feature, mostly from before 2017.

## Games

* *Bird Breaker*, an Atari breakout spinoff in the air with different plane designs and levels, including the infamous Bird King!
* *Minesweeper*, which features an algorithm to solve an arbitrary board which I designed from scratch.
* *Fourier Sketch*, a toy demonstration of the power of the Fourier Transform which traces any drawing you make using only rotating circles.
* *Gravity Pong*, which adds a slight spin (more accurately, pull) to the rules of normal Pong, plus an AI that can see the future.
* *3D Engine*, featuring a built-from-scratch physics engine which connects to the Three.js rendering library.
* *Editable World*, a 2D Minecraft spinoff built in C# from so, so long ago.

## Academy

The Academy is a special part of Arongil.com, dedicated to housing the many math videos I created originally for my YouTube channel [Arongil Productions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPHYx1dQWrgfTlUtblwec_A). Also featured:

* Complete lectures from the theoretical linear algebra course I taught at Khan Lab School in 2021
* Complete series covering differential equations from 2018
* Some miscellaneous tools I built, like a Gram-Schmidt "Function Fudger"
