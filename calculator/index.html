      <p class="small">
          There were two goals in building this calculator: programming a <a href="calculator.js">parser</a> and a
        <a href="LMath.js">math functions library</a>. The parser should use PFEMDAS (parentheses, functions, exponents, multiplication,
        division, addition, subtraction), calculating first P, then F, then E, then M and D, and finally A and S. The goal with LMath
        was to program a library of math functions from scratch. No Math.sin, Math.floor, or Math.exp, only LMath.sin, LMath.floor, and
        LMath.exp, in addition to the rest of LMath methods and constants.
      </p>
      <p class="big center">How Does it Work?</p>
      <p class="medium center">Overview</p>
<!--   <span class="green">parser</span>     -->
<!--   <span class="blue">LMath</span>     -->
      <p class="small">
          There are two parts to this calculator: a <span class="green">parser</span> that organizes the expression entered, 
        breaking it up by operators and parentheses into simpler 1-step operations the computer can do, and a library of math 
        functions, such as sin, sqrt, and ln, called <span class="blue">LMath</span>.
        <br><br>
          The <span class="green">parser</span> could, for
        example, take an input like <str>4 * (1 - 9)</str> and determine, first, there are parentheses, so calculate them first.
        <str>1 - 9 = -8</str> so replace <str>(1 - 9)</str> with <str>-8</str>, giving a new input of <str>4 * -8</str>. The
        <span class="green">parser</span> again checks for parentheses, finds none, so checks for functions and exponents. When it finds
        none, it checks for multiplication and division. It finds multiplication, performs <str>4 * -8 = -32</str>, and replaces
        <str>4 * -8</str> with <str>-32</str>. When the parser finds no addition or subtraction following -32, it realizes -32 is the
        only term left, so returns it as the answer. In programatic terms, the parser performs PFEMDAS (parentheses, functions, exponents,
        multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) on its input, recursively PFEMDASing the contents of each parenthesis pair and 
        replacing the original input's parentheses with the result.
        <br><br>
          The <span class="blue">LMath</span> library could tell the <span class="green">parser</span> what the ln(44) is, if it needed to
        know because, say, its input was 1 + ln(44).
